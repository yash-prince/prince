//     INHERITANCE IN C++

/* Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
in C++ we can reuse a class and a add additional features to it
reusing classes saves time and money
reusing already teste\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\6d and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again.
*/

/* The concept of reusbility in c++ is supporyedusing inheritance
we can reuse the properties of an existingclass by inheriting from it
the existing class is called as "BASE CLASS"
the new class which is inherited is caleed as the "DERIVED CLASS"
*/

// THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INHERITENCE
/*
1. multiple inheritence
2. hierarchucal inherirence
3. nultilevel inheritence
4. hybrid  inheritence
5. single inheritence
*/

// SINGLE INHERITENCE : a derivrd class with only one base class
// MULTIPLE INHERITENCE : a derived class with more than one Base class ( ex:(employee , assistant - programmer)).
// HIERARCHICAL INHERITENCE : it is derived classes from a singlr base class.
// MULTILEVEL INHERITENCE: deriving a class from derived class.[(A-B-C)MAMMAL = AMIMAL +MORE ,COW= MAMMAL + MORE]

//    HYBRID INHERITENCE
/*
HYBRID  is a combination of multiple inheritence and multilevel inheritence
a class is derived from two class as in multiple inheritence
however one of the parent classes is not a base class [A-{B,C}((B,C)-D)]
