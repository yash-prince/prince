// ## WHY OOPS
//C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object oriented features to c++ language .
//as the sizze of the programme increses readability, maintainability  and and bug-free nature of programs increases.
//this was the mmajor problem with language like C which will relied upon functions or procedure(hence the name procedural  programming language)
//as a result the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high .
// also as data was almost neglected ,data security was easily compromiswd .
//using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario .

// PROCEDURE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.....
//Main focus is on function and not on flow of data 
//functions can either use local or globL data
//data moves openly from function to function

// OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ....
//works on the concept of classes and objects
//A class is a template to create objects 
//Treats data as a critical element 
//Decomposes the problem in objects and builds a data and functions  around the objects.

//###### BASIC CONCEPTS IN OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING .............
//Classes- Baasic template for creating objects .
//objects-basic run time entities .
//Data Abstractiom & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit .
//Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others .
//polymorphism-Ability to take more than one form.
// Dynmic Binding -Code which will execute is not known until the program runs .
//Message passing-object message (information ) call format

//###BENEFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.......
//Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
//principle of data hiding helps build secure system.
// Multiple objects can be easily co-exist without any interference .
